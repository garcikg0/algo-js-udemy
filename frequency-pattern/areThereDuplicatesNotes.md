The frequency counter pattern is keeping track of the frequency of data through an object.
After we've constructed this object, we can use it to determine our ouput! 
It's kinda like a mini-inventory of what we have. 


One Liner: 
function areThereDuplicates(){
    return new Set(arguments).size !== arguments.length;
}
