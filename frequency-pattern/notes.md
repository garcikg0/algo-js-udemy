This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. 

Time Complexity: O(n)

Make sure both arrays have th same number of elements

We want to avoid nested loops as much as possible. 

Two seperate loops are better than a nested loop. 

Use an objet to break down content of array or string then quickly compare it with another array or string.
